        Things I like
    </h2>
    <p>
        I love playing video games, listening to music, and reading fictional novels. I also like exploring different facets of the IT field, though I may not always understand what I see/read, it's still fascinating to learn new things.

    <p>
        I am Indian, and my hometown is in Calicut in the state of Kerala, India. Kerala has many great beaches and great climate as it is located close to the Indian Ocean, so the coastline and beaches are great places to visit. The monsoon season is pretty pleasant as long as you keep an umbrella handy!

    <p>
        I was born and raised in Abbassiya, Kuwait in a family of 4, consisting of my father, mother and elder sister. Since I grew up here, it has always had a special place in my mind. The climate is rather harsh, as it is a desert, with summers being extremely hot and winters being surprisingly cold, but in my mind, it's still a beautiful land.
